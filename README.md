<h1>Dear Puru,</h1>
<p>I hope this message finds you well. I want to sincerely apologize for my reaction the other night. I never meant to imply anything negative, and I regret if my words made you feel that way.</p>
<p>Communication can sometimes be challenging, especially in a long-distance relationship. I just want you to know that you mean a lot to me, and I trust you completely. The last thing I want is to create misunderstandings between us.</p>
<p>I cherish our relationship and all the moments we've shared. I promise to be more understanding and open in the future. Please forgive me for my mistake.</p>
<p>Looking forward to hearing from you soon.</p>
<p>With all my love,<br>Sanskar</p>
